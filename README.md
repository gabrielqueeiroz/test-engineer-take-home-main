# Take-Home Project for Software Testing Engineer Role

Welcome to the take-home project repository for candidates applying for the Software Testing Engineer role. This repository contains two separate projects, labeled `hardware` and `software`. Each project is designed to test different skill sets related to software development and testing.

## Overview

This repository is divided into two main directories:

- **`hardware`**: This project involves tasks related to embedded systems and automation testing, including the creation of a mock for a DAQ device and integration with CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
- **`software`**: This project focuses on software development and testing practices, requiring candidates to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a software application.

Each directory has its own `README.md` file containing specific instructions and requirements for the project. You may choose to complete one or both of the projects. Completing both projects is highly encouraged and will demonstrate a broader skill set.

## Projects

### Hardware Project
- **Location**: `./hardware`
- **Description**: Implement a mock for a DAQ device, simulate digital pin toggling, and write tests to verify this behavior. Integrate the project with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

### Software Project
- **Location**: `./software`
- **Description**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for a software application. Ensure that the pipeline effectively manages build, test, and deployment processes.

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your projects, follow these steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Fork this repository or create a new private GitHub repository to house your projects. Ensure that the repository is set to **private**.
2. **Collaborators**: Add Adriano (`@opassos`) and Xiao (`@xyk2`) as collaborators to your private repository.
3. **Project Structure**: Maintain a clean and organized structure with separate directories for the `hardware` and `software` projects.
4. **Commit Regularly**: Make regular commits to demonstrate your progress and version control practices.
5. **Readme Files**: Ensure each project directory contains a detailed `README.md` with instructions on running the projects and any necessary documentation. Feel free to rename the current `README.md` file to `README_OLD.md`
6. **Final Submission**: Notify Adriano and Xiao via email or GitHub once you have completed the project and are ready for review.

### Optional:
After the interview process is complete, you are welcome to make the repository public to use it as part of your portfolio.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Completeness**: Completion of all specified tasks in the projects.
- **Code Quality**: Cleanliness, organization, and documentation of code.
- **Functionality**: Accuracy and reliability of the implemented features.
- **CI/CD Practices**: Effective setup and usage of continuous integration and deployment techniques.

We look forward to reviewing your innovative solutions and wish you the best of luck!
